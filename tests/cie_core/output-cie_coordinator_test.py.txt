Formatted report: `## Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope: An Overview

This report provides an overview of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), its iconic "Pillars of Creation" image, and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) as its successor and complement. The report highlights the significance and impact of these telescopes on astronomy and public understanding of the universe.

It was not the first space telescope , but it is one of the largest and most versatile, renowned as a vital research tool and as a public relations boon for astronomy . The Hubble Space Telescope is named after astronomer Edwin Hubble and is one of NASA 's Great Observatories . The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) selects Hubble's targets and processes the resulting data, while the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) controls the spacecraft. [ 8 ]\nHubble features a 2.4\xa0m (7\xa0ft 10\xa0in) mirror, and its five main instruments observe in the ultraviolet , visible , and near-infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum . Hubble's orbit outside the distortion of Earth's atmosphere allows it to capture extremely high-resolution images with substantially lower background light than ground-based telescopes. It has recorded some of the most detailed visible light images, allowing a deep view into space. Many Hubble observations have led to breakthroughs in astrophysics , such as determining the rate of expansion of the universe .\nThe Hubble Space Telescope was funded and built in the 1970s by NASA with contributions from the European Space Agency . Its intended launch was in 1983, but the project was beset by technical delays, budget problems, and the 1986 Challenger disaster . Hubble was launched on STS-31 in 1990, but its main mirror h"}, {'title': 'Pillars of Creation - Wikipedia', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillars_of_Creation', 'content': '\n\nPillars of Creation is a photograph taken by the Hubble Space Telescope that depicts elephant trunks of interstellar gas and dust in the Eagle Nebula of the Serpens constellation, some 6,500–7,000 light-years (2,000–2,100\xa0pc; 61–66\xa0Em) from Earth. [ 1 ] These elephant trunks had been discovered by John Charles Duncan in 1920 on a plate made with the Mount Wilson Observatory 60-inch telescope . [ 2 ] [ 3 ] They are so named because the gas and dust are in the process of creating new stars, while also being eroded by the light from nearby stars that have recently formed. [ 4 ]\nTaken on April 1, 1995, it was named one of the top ten photographs from Hubble by Space.com . [ 5 ] The astronomers responsible for the photo were Jeff Hester and Paul Scowen from Arizona State University . The region was rephotographed by ESA \'s Herschel Space Observatory in 2011, again by Hubble in 2014 with a newer camera, and the James Webb Space Telescope in 2022.\nReleased in 2007, Chandra X-ray Observatory (AXAF) had observed the area in 2001. It did not find many X-ray sources in the towers but was able to observe sources at various X-ray energy levels in the area from young stars. [ 6 ]\nThe image is noted for its global culture impact,  being considered the most iconic picture taken by the Hubble Space Telescope [ 7 ] and National Geographic noting on its 20th anniversary that the image had been featured on everything from "t-shirts to coffee-mugs". [ 8 ]\nThe name is based on a phrase used by C'}, {'content': "\nThe James Webb Space Telescope ( JWST ) is a space telescope designed to conduct infrared astronomy . As the largest telescope in space, it is equipped with high-resolution and high-sensitivity instruments, allowing it to view objects too old, distant , or faint for the Hubble Space Telescope . [ 9 ] This enables investigations across many fields of astronomy and cosmology , such as observation of the first stars and the formation of the first galaxies , and detailed atmospheric characterization of potentially habitable exoplanets . [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ]\nAlthough the Webb's mirror diameter is 2.7 times larger than that of the Hubble Space Telescope, it produces images of comparable resolution because it observes in the longer-wavelength infrared spectrum. The longer the wavelength of the spectrum, the larger the information-gathering surface required (mirrors in the infrared spectrum or antenna area in the millimeter and radio ranges) for an image comparable in clarity to the visible spectrum of the Hubble Space Telescope.\nThe Webb was launched on 25 December 2021 on an Ariane 5 rocket from Kourou , French Guiana. In January 2022 it arrived at its destination, a solar orbit near the Sun–Earth L 2 Lagrange point , about 1.5\xa0million kilometers (930,000\xa0mi) from Earth. The telescope's first image was released to the public on 11 July 2022.
