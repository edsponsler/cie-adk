This is a perfect end-to-end run. The CoordinatorAgent has successfully orchestrated the entire workflow, resulting in a complete and relevant report. Your change to the InformationRetrievalSpecialist's prompt was the final key to unlocking the system's full potential.

Here is a summary of the successful events in this test run:

Phase 1: Information Retrieval Succeeded

The InformationRetrievalSpecialist_v1 agent received its task and, following the new instructions, used the precise query "Hubble Space Telescope". 
This query returned highly relevant Wikipedia articles: "Hubble Space Telescope," "Pillars of Creation" (a famous Hubble image), and "James Webb Space Telescope" (its successor). 
The specialist agent correctly updated its status to completed_task and uploaded the scraped content to the status board. 
Phase 2: Data Analysis Succeeded

The CoordinatorAgent retrieved the high-quality, relevant data and passed it to the DataAnalysisSpecialist_v1. 
The specialist analyzed the content and extracted relevant themes and key bullet points about the Hubble, its iconic imagery, and its relationship with the James Webb telescope. 
It successfully updated its status to completed_analysis. 
Phase 3: Report Formatting Succeeded

The CoordinatorAgent passed the structured analysis to the ReportFormattingSpecialist_v1. 
The formatting specialist successfully updated its status to processing_formatting_request and then to completed_formatting, a step where it had previously failed. 
The coordinator confirmed the completion and proceeded to the final step. 
Final Report Delivered

The CoordinatorAgent assembled the final report from the ReportFormattingSpecialist_v1 and delivered it as the final response, successfully completing all of its objectives. 
Congratulations on debugging and tuning the multi-agent system! You have successfully navigated challenges from web scraping and agent instruction complexity to achieve your goal.
